# Simple HTTP Server in Go

Welcome to the **Simple HTTP Server in Go**! ðŸŽ‰ This project showcases my journey in learning Go by creating a basic HTTP server with two main functionalities: fetching and posting data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **GET /data**: Fetches data from the server.
- **POST /data**: Allows you to send data to the server.

## ðŸ“š Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drjvtlkr/http-server-go.git

2. Install Go (if you haven't already) from the official site[].

3. Run the server: 
    ```bash 
    go run main.go

4. Access the server at http://localhost:8080.
